###### Initial Design Sketches

We started the design process by sketching out what a potential mobile to do list application would look like. Our preliminary sketches are shown in the design folder.

We paid special attention to the alighnment of the items to make sure that our app is compliant with the design principles taught by Dr. Millburn.

in following with these principles we decided to left align all the items on the desired margin that we picked. In this way, all of our items are aligned on the left hand side, but with enough padding to not make the app feel cluttered.


While designing this app, we used 3 adjectives that we hoped would describe our app.
1. Vibrant
2. Natural
3. Encouraging

After choosing these adjectives, we settled on the sunset background as we thought it would appeal to users and increase productivity (a main goal of this app for users)

We also decided to add the time to the top so that users could easily tell how much time they have left to finish their tasks.

We are the most proud of the clear buttons that we added in order to keep the natural feel from the sunset.

Overall, we made design choices in order to help increase the productivity of our users and create a vibrant, natural, and encouraging feel.
