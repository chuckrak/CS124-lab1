###### Initial Design Sketches

We started the design process by sketching out what a potential mobile to do list application would look like. Our preliminary sketches are below.

We paid special attention to the alighnment of the items to make sure that our app is compliant with the design principles taught by Dr. Millburn.


While designing this app, we hoped to convey 3 feelings to the users.
1. Vibrant
2. Natural
3. Encouraging
